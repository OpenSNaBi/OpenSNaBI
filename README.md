# OpenSNaBI
An Open book with tables of information relevant to Chemistry (Scheikunde), Physics (Natuurkunde), and Biology (Biologie).

The book will be in **Dutch**, and have a Creative Commons license (no ND, no NC clauses, maybe even
CCZero). The book will be autogenerated from data files with the help of LaTeX, and include full provenance
about where information comes from. As much as possible, we use scripts to download data from repositories
during the building.
